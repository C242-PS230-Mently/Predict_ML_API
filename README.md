# Predict-ML API
Repository for machine learning API Model to Deploy in CC
# API for Determining Stress Levels : Mently App
This is a repository for hosting Machine Learning model APIs that will be deployed and can be used in applications.
## Overview
By using this API, it will bring up the results of determining a person's stress level based on the answers to the questions they have answered in the application. The results will appear in the application in the form of charts for 5 mental health disorders.

## Setup

### Requirements
To install all the libraries needed in this model, use the syntax below:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/C242-PS230-Mently/PredictAPI_ML.git

# Change directory
cd PredictAPI_ML # change with your folder name

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

There are a few things that need to be done to use this API:
1. Run the Flask API
   ```bash
   python app.py
    ```
   The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
2. Make a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict` with input data in JSON format:
   ```plaintext
   {
    "Q1": 2, "Q2": 2, "Q3": 2, "Q4": 2, "Q5": 2,
    "Q6": 1, "Q7": 1, "Q8": 1, "Q9": 1, "Q10": 1,
    "Q11": 3, "Q12": 3, "Q13": 3, "Q14": 3, "Q15": 3,
    "Q16": 1, "Q17": 1, "Q18": 1, "Q19": 1, "Q20": 1,
    "Q21": 1, "Q22": 1, "Q23": 1, "Q24": 1, "Q25": 1
    }

   ```
   The API will display the prediction results (anxiety level, depression level, bipolar level, schizophrenia level, OCD level).
## Model
The machine learning model `(Model_Fix_RF_TF.pkl)` is loaded during API initialization and used for predictions.

## Endpoints
- **Endpoint**: /predict
- **Method**: POST
- **Input**: JSON data with features for prediction
- **Output**: *prediction*, *accuracy percentage*, and *list of related scholarship information*.
